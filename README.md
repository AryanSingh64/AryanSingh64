## Hey there! 👋

I'm Aryan, a web developer and designer based in India.
I like building things that actually look good **and** work properly.  
Started with frontend because I love design, visuals, and motion and now slowly getting my hands dirty with backend too.

If an idea sticks in my head, I usually try to build it instead of just talking about it.

### Tech Stack
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js
- Styling & Motion: Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- Backend: Node.js, Express, MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- Tools: Git, GitHub, Figma, VS Code

### Currently
- Learning backend properly (no shortcuts this time)
- Working on full-stack projects instead of just UI demos
- Trying to turn ideas into real, usable products

### Projects
I've built multiple frontend projects, UI concepts, and small full-stack experiments.  
Some are polished, some are rough but all of them taught me something.

(Yeah, the repo count is high. I like experimenting.)

### Fun Facts
- I love clean UI, smooth animations, and dark themes
- Anime > most TV shows
- Horror movies, but the slow-burn, psychological kind
- Music is always playing while I code
- I overthink designs more than logic sometimes

If you like clean design, honest learning journeys, or just building cool stuff.
